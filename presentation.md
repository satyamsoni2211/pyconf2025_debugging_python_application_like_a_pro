## Why is `Debugging` important 

- Approximately 85-90% of developers rely on `print` statements for code tracing.
- Code modifications often result in unexpected errors.
- Lack of understanding of the call stack.
- Significant time is spent diagnosing issues.

Moreover,

Errors remain elusive...
This can be quite frustrating ðŸ¤¯, don't you agree?
